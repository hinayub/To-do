To-Do List App – Overview
Your To-Do List App is a simple, modern web application that allows users to:

✅ Add new to-do items

🗑️ Delete completed or unwanted tasks

📋 Possibly mark items as completed or active

It uses:

HTML for structure (index.html)

CSS (likely included) for modern visual styling

JavaScript for interactivity (such as adding/removing tasks)

AI tools used in each phase:
1)Planning & Requirements

3)Development
    I uses Git Copilot to generate the code.
